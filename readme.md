[![logo of pumpncode/logos][logo-wide]][self]

This is the repository for all the logos for Pumpn Code projects. It includes Adobe Illustrator source files, as well as various ready-to-use variants in SVG and PNG formats. For authors, it also includes scripts to help automate the process of exporting the logos in various formats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Deno][deno]
- [Node.js][node-js]

### Installation

1. Install dependencies for local development:

	```sh
	npm install
	```

## Usage

`<project-names>` below is a comma-separated list of project names. The project names are the names of the directories in the "projects" directory and these folders need to exist except for the `create-base` command.

### Create a base logo for a new project (not really working yet)

```sh
deno task create-base <project-names>
```

### Generate variants of a logo

```sh
deno task generate-variants <project-names>
```

### Convert project logos from SVG to PNG

```sh
deno task convert-to-png <project-names>
```

### Generate variants and convert to PNG in one command (might only work on unix systems)

```sh
deno task process <project-names>
```
